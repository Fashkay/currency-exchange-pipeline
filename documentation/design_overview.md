# Design of the Chosen Pipeline

## Architecture Overview

The Currency Exchange Rate Data Acquisition and Preprocessing Pipeline is designed with a modular and extensible architecture. It consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Acquisition Module**:
   - Responsible for interfacing with the chosen API to retrieve currency exchange rate data.
   - Allows users to input the base and target currencies for which they want to obtain exchange rates.

2. **Preprocessing and Transformation Module**:
   - Focuses on normalizing the acquired exchange rates to a standardized format.
   - Performs data validation to ensure the integrity and quality of the acquired data.

3. **Database Integration Module**:
   - Manages interactions with the database, including schema setup, data insertion, and retrieval operations.
   - Ensures data integrity and handles potential exceptions during database interactions.

4. **Demonstration Script**:
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for executing the pipeline.
   - Guides users through the process of acquiring, preprocessing, and storing exchange rate data.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Modularity**: Each component of the pipeline is designed as a separate module, allowing for independent development, testing, and potential future extensions.

- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented at each stage of the pipeline to gracefully handle potential issues, such as API request failures or database connectivity problems.

- **Database Schema Design**: The database schema is designed to efficiently store currency exchange rate data, with appropriate data types and constraints to ensure data integrity.

- **User Interaction**: The demonstration script provides clear prompts for user input and offers informative feedback at each step of the process, enhancing user experience.

- **Version Control and Documentation**: Git is utilized for version control, ensuring proper tracking of code changes, while documentation is maintained in plain text format within the repository for accessibility and collaboration.

## Future Considerations

As the project evolves, future considerations may include:

- **Support for Multiple APIs**: Extending the data acquisition module to support multiple APIs for greater flexibility in data sources.

- **Enhanced Data Validation**: Implementing more advanced data validation techniques to further ensure the quality and reliability of acquired data.

- **Additional Database Functionality**: Introducing features such as data aggregation, querying, and reporting for enhanced data analysis capabilities.

The chosen design emphasizes flexibility, reliability, and user-friendliness, making the pipeline adaptable to various use cases within the domain of currency exchange rate data management.
