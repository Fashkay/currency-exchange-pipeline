# Design Overview

## Project Structure

The Currency Exchange Rate Data Acquisition and Preprocessing Pipeline is designed as a modular system composed of three main components: Data Acquisition, Preprocessing and Transformation, and Database Integration.

### Data Acquisition Module

The Data Acquisition module is responsible for interacting with the specified API to retrieve currency exchange rate data. It utilizes the provided API key and parameters such as base currency and target currency to construct API requests.

### Preprocessing and Transformation Module

The Preprocessing and Transformation module focuses on normalizing the acquired exchange rates. This step ensures that the data is suitable for storage in the database and further analysis. The module includes functions for rounding exchange rates to a fixed number of decimal places.

### Database Integration Module

The Database Integration module manages interactions with the PostgreSQL database. It provides functions for creating the necessary tables and inserting exchange rate data. This module ensures efficient storage and retrieval of data.

## Workflow Overview

The Currency Exchange Rate Data Acquisition and Preprocessing Pipeline follows a sequential workflow:

1. **Data Acquisition Phase**:
   - The Data Acquisition module retrieves exchange rate data from the specified API using the provided API key and parameters.

2. **Preprocessing and Transformation Phase**:
   - The Preprocessing and Transformation module normalizes the acquired exchange rates to ensure data consistency.

3. **Database Integration Phase**:
   - The Database Integration module handles interactions with the PostgreSQL database. It creates the required tables and inserts the preprocessed exchange rate data.

## Modular Design

The modular design of the pipeline allows for easy maintenance, scalability, and flexibility. Each module operates independently, facilitating code reusability and enhancing the overall robustness of the system.

## Error Handling and Logging

The pipeline incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to handle potential issues during data acquisition, preprocessing, and database operations. Detailed logs are generated to aid in troubleshooting and debugging.

## Future Enhancements

The design of the pipeline allows for future enhancements and extensions. Potential areas for improvement include support for additional APIs, advanced preprocessing techniques, and expanded database functionality for comprehensive data analysis.
